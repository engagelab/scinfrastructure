		The Java Advanced Imaging API extends the Java 2 platform by allowing sophisticated, high-performance image processing to be incorporated into Java applets and applications. It is a set of classes providing imaging functionality beyond that of Java 2D and the Java Foundation classes, though it is designed for compatibility with those APIs. This API implements a set of core image processing capabilities including image tiling, regions of interest, deferred execution and a set of core image processing operators, including many common point, area, and frequency domain operators.
